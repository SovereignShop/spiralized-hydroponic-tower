# Spiralized Tower

This is code for a rapidly printable hydroponic tower. It's designed almost entirely printed with "spiralized outer contours" and a 0.8mm nozzle. Simply set the bottom layer with to 5.0mm and print away.

NOTE: Cura changed (broke) the spiralized contours implementation in 5.x. Use 4.x to spiralize properly. On the flip side, the non-spiralized handling of single-wall prints is grealy improved in 5.x, so you'll generally get good quality without spiralized contours as well.
